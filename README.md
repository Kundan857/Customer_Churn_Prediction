# Customer_Churn_Prediction
This project predicts whether a customer will leave or stay using a trained Random Forest model based on 19 customer features like gender, tenure, contract type, payment method, and more. Built using Flask, HTML/CSS, and scikit-learn, the app provides a simple web interface for predictions.
